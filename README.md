# Simple Plate Detection (Python)

A tiny demo project highlighting 4 classic image-processing steps for license-plate detection:
*grayscale → edges → binary → plate detection* (with a bounding box drawn around the plate).

This isn’t meant as a full detection pipeline — just a simple school project that can be tweaked and extended to your liking.
